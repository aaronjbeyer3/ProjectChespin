Pokemon database project

Not sure what this will become.
Somewhat just creating a Pokemon database for fun. But with the database I'll be able to create a lot of different Pokemon tools to use.

Tool Ex: Pokemon Eliminationlocke randomizer
  - Instead of messing with random number generators, why not just have a tool that randomizes you team for you?
  - Could be used for eliminationlockes, trioeliminationlockes, etc.
  - Could implement different rules (what gens pokemon are from, apocolocke conditions, types, etc).
